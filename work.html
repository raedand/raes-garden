  <h2 class="">this website</h2>
  <p>
    this website/tiddlywiki is a result of my research of digital gardens and personal knowledge networks. 
    the idea behind this website is to have one place to keep not only all of my own thoughts, but information 
    and knowledge i've collected from elsewhere. the beauty of tiddlywiki, is that it is non-linear, my thoughts 
    constantly link to each other in my brain, so this wiki does the same.

  <p>
    pythia was less of a project and more of a learning experience. following a tutorial, i was able to teach 
    myself python as well as how to create a simple character level recursive neural network which could then 
    generate text. when I started pythia I barely knew any python, over the course of it's creation, i was able
    to take a deep dive into python, neural networks, and natural language processing. as a result, i went through
    many iterations of the model but have successfully generated poetry from it. it was fed poetry from only lgbt+
    poets and poets of color. pythia is on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/raedand/pythia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">github</a> 
    and some of the poetry she has generated can be found on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.are.na/rae-d/generated-poetry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are.na</a>.

    iona is a simple page template for tumblr that pulls data from a google sheet. the tumblr coding community is
    frequently ignored due to most of it's members being young women. however, i have found that this community is 
    probably one of the most welcoming to young people learning web design. iona takes snippets of code from various
    other coders who are kind enough to publish tutorials and code for others to use, valuing the sharing of knowledge
    and collective learning. the beauty of Iona is not in its appearance but in the community that allowed it to be
    created. iona can be found on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://voirvir.tumblr.com/iona#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tumblr</a>
    along with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://voirvir.tumblr.com/post/183967340226/iona-update-organization-page-new-features" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">code</a>.

    &quot;immature&quot; zine is a zine dedicated to young creators and sharing their voices. this zine is a series 
    of interviews with smaller creators under 21. my mission was to encourage creators to learn from, connect with,
    and share with other creators. you can download the zine on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://raedand.itch.io/immature001" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">itch.io</a>
